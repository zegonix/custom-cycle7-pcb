This repository holds the design sources for a custom PCB and plate for the cycle 7 by TKD.

**this is work in progress and not ready for production**

Why? Bootloader on TKD's PCB ~~is shit~~ does not comply with my requirements. Also the firmware is proprietary.

What about this PCB? Sources are here and if I get it working I will open a pull request to commit the firmware to qmk repository. **However use at your own risk, I do not guarantee any of this to be functional**
